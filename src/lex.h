	`skil_token` reads the next token from `input`, returning it's type.

	params:
		input - a FILE* object opened for reading, from which tokens
		will be read.

		img - used to store a string associated with the the token.
		for details, see the section "return value", below. Note
		that for some tokens (e.g. '('), *img may be set to NULL after
		the call, if the type fully captures the information in the
		token.

		if *img is *not* NULL upon return, then it is a malloc-allocated
		string, and the caller is responsible for freeing it.

	return value:
		One of the legal token types, or a negative value, indicating
		an error. The possible error codes are:

		- SKIL_ENOMEM
		- SKIL_BAD_TOKEN

		(see errcode.h).

		The legal token types are:

		'(' - an opening parenthesis. *img will be NULL.
		')' - a closing parenthesis. *img will be NULL.
		SKIL_EOF - The end of file. *img will be NULL.
		SKIL_ATOM - an atom. *img will point to a string representing
			the atom.

	postconditions:
		Either the return value will be one of the (negative) error
		codes mentioned above, or:

		The return value indicates the type of token that was read,
		and the value of *img corresponds to the token type, as
		described under "return value", above.
